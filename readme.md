Some React code from a php and jquery developer. I had a lot of great learning on this mini project. Ask me about how I might approach this project differently in the future. 

Live Demo: https://nps.jeffreyducharme.com/

Built w/: React, Easy Peasy state management (minimal), Webpack, Webpack dev server, Bootstrap, SCSS, and love.

The NPS tool itself is styled mostly with CSS grid, not bootstrap grid.
